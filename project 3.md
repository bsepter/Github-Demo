Description of the project
This is a description of a data analysis of students at Brown school on where they come from and their favorite things such as seasons and drinks.

Description of the code
The codes in this  dataset analysis include libraries to clean the data by handling missing values and standardizing entries. Descriptive statistics will be calculated, and cross-tabulations will analyze relationships between variables like pet preferences and education levels. Visualization tools such as ggplot2 will create bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to display trends and insights from the data.
